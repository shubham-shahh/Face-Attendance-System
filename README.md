### Problem Statement
The Existing attendance system used by the client was slow, inefficent, unreliable and consisted several loopholes. The new system had to overcome all the shortcomings of existing system at a low cost. A new pipeline was required to register the attendance of 500+ employees with high accuracy and low processing time.

#### Approach
Face attendance system can be of 2 types
* **Verification based sytem** - In such systems, usually a sub-system is used based on RFID or some other identifiers. The role of face recognition is to verify if the RFID credentials belongs to the person presenting it.

* **Recognition based system** - These systems solely depends on facial features and do not require any sub system for authentiaction.

To make cost effective solution and keep the complexity of the system minimum, we developed a Recognition based face attendance system. We throughly researched all the possible solutions available for the purpose of face recognition, vigorously tried and tested them and after 100+ iterations we sucessfully developed a solution, which met all the client demands along with additional perks.
